              Ahmedabad Is Quietly Becoming the GIFT City Feeder Town. Should You Bet on It?
            </h1>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              On paper, GIFT City — India's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in Gandhinagar — was supposed to be the next Dubai or Singapore for offshore finance. In reality, it's still a work in progress: a cluster of glass towers in Gujarat offering tax breaks to banks, funds, and insurers willing to set up shop. But here's the part the headlines miss: most of the people working there don't actually live in GIFT City. They live in Ahmedabad.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              That shift is turning Ahmedabad into something more interesting than a "Tier 2" city. It's becoming the real heartbeat of the GIFT City experiment: the place where the bankers, fund managers, IT staff, and consultants sleep, eat, and spend their money.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-10 mb-4">Why Ahmedabad Works as the Base</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              GIFT City is about 25–30 minutes from central Ahmedabad, and the commute is easy compared to Mumbai or Bangalore. Ahmedabad already has the infrastructure GIFT City lacks: better housing stock, international schools, hospitals, and a dining scene that's quietly gone upscale in the last five years. You can have a work meeting in a GIFT City boardroom at 4 p.m., be back at a rooftop bar on SG Highway by 6, and still make it home for dinner.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              For the finance crowd, there's also familiarity. Ahmedabad is home turf for many of the Gujarati entrepreneurs and executives leading the push into GIFT City. Moving the family here is a softer landing than relocating to an isolated business park.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-10 mb-4">Who's Moving In</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              It's not just bank employees. Law firms, tax advisors, fintech startups, and even wealth managers are taking flats in Ahmedabad to service GIFT City clients. This is bringing in a mix of young professionals on high packages and senior expats on short-term assignments. Rents in premium areas like Bodakdev and Prahladnagar have jumped 15–20% in the past two years, according to local brokers. High-end developers like Shivalik and Safal are openly marketing to "GIFT professionals" in their sales pitches.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-10 mb-4">Is There an Investment Play?</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The obvious angle is residential property. Buying in the right micro-markets could ride the wave if GIFT City keeps attracting tenants. But it's not a slam dunk. Ahmedabad's real estate market has historically been conservative, with steady but unspectacular appreciation. Overpaying for hype could lock you into a long hold with mediocre yields.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Commercial space is trickier. Many GIFT-focused firms still prefer to lease small offices near their staff's homes, which means the most lucrative plays are on the leasing side, not speculative purchases.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              Another angle: services. GIFT City is still building its own ecosystem of restaurants, gyms, and retail, but professionals don't want to spend every evening in a corporate zone. There's room for high-quality hospitality, health, and lifestyle businesses in Ahmedabad targeting the GIFT crowd.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-10 mb-4">The Five-Year View</h2>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              If GIFT City succeeds in drawing sustained foreign capital flows, Ahmedabad will benefit from more executives, more families, and more service demand. If it stalls, the city will still have its own industrial and commercial base to fall back on, but without the same premium inflows.
            </p>
            
            <p className="mb-6">
              The smart money isn't betting the farm on GIFT City hype alone. It's picking assets in Ahmedabad that make sense even without the IFSC halo. If the big vision plays out, those positions become a double win.
